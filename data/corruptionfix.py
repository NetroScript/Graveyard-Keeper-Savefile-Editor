# My personal save file from the beginning has an error in the string encoding of the Serializer which is fixed with the following code
# You probably don't need it unless you have the same type of corruption in the savefile
# If you get other errors and know what you are doing, feel free to add a fix for them here

# To update the description from above. It seems the game used unicode characters when saving, I load the characters
# as Ascii (more or less) meaning in the case of a character having more than 1 Byte it throws an error because it will
# be offset (the word length and read bytes). Because it seems there are only specific characters where this happens
# this code is enough as special cases for the characters which are longer than 1 Byte - in the future it is possible
# that more fixes need to be added


# A fix for the direct buffer of the characters
# If a fix was applied we add the original length and buffer so that we can save that information
# before was the bug that we encoded Unicode Characters as Ascii (as single Byte) leading to errors when the game was
# loading the file.
