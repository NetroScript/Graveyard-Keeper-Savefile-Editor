World game objects
------------------
  
In the file save (exportet as JSON) you have in `savedata->map->v->_wgos->v` a list with all "World Game Objects" of the game.  
Those include all interactable objects and more. The game saves the location of those. These include f.e. spots where hiccup grass grows, meaning you could change its location next to your house or even duplicate the objects (is what I assume, I didn't try it)  
Other interesting things you could change there are f.e. location of built objects, teleport spots (?, ids teleport_hatch, teleport_inside, teleport_outside, teleport_point - 1 teleport_hatch / teleport_inside / teleport_outside corresponds with 1 teleport_point because they have the same custom tag, meaning you probably can create new teleport points f.e. 1 infront of your house to the lighthouse) or NPC objects.  
Meaning if your NPC is broken you could try replacing it's data with the data from a save where it is not broken. (As far as I can tell no achievement or progress related data is stored in them, but I only took a look at a early game save).  
  
A list of a 10 Minute save with all the possible world game object ids and their amounts would be (as JSON):

```

With this data (because all of them contain a location) it should be possible to recreate your current world map if you extract the base map (the underground) + the sprites of the id's.

Achievements
------------

The number progress of achievements is stored in `savedata->achievements->v`
If you f.e. started to catch 200 fish, you could find the entry with "fish_200" in _completed->v and at the same index in _completed_n->v you can set it f.e. to 199 and then fish 1 more fish to get the achievement.  
Same is possible with other achievements.  

Workers
-------

Your worker zombies are stored in `savedata->workers`.  
I didn't have much time to inspect it, but they all have an inventory and their organs are also stored, meaning by changing the organ attributes you can change the efficiency f.e. of a worker.

Unlocked Technologies
---------------------

In `savedata->unlocked_techs` are your unlocked technologies (obviously), but the editor doesn't feature anything there because you can simply give you red, green and blue points to get them.
